conference1,"It was easy to find the first two pieces of information, but finding the registration form was a little more difficult than I would have liked.  The confusing part was that I was on the page entitled ""harvardusindiainitiative.com"" and the registration form was on ""harvardindiainitiative.com.""  I didn't immediately realize these were two different sites because the URLs are a bit long and unwieldy.  ."
