Everything was very easy to locate, the layout is pleasing and the images fit the subject matter at hand.  Nothing I see has made the site difficult to navigate around and the menu directs you to the area you want easily.","The website is nicely layed out and the images go well with the topic at hand.  The only issue I had was the menu interaction could be a bit more fluid as it highlights like you can interact with it, when you cannot until you get the mouse in the middle and the cursor changes.  This causes a few extra clicks to be needed to change pages.","The website is setup in a logical manner with everything you need either in the menu or on the page.  I had no issues navigating around and finding any information needed.","The only interaction I notice that wasn't fluid was the menu buttons would highlight like you could click them to switch menus before they could be interacted with.  You have to wait till not only the menu highlights, but the cursor turns into the hand icon to select the menu to change pages.","3","1","1","1","Disha Verma","Oct 16, 2014","Form Name - HUII","The website clearly states is purpose and goals.
