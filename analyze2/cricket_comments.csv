easy to navigate
its about the two school
no seems simple
The website was fine.
Everything worked well.
The website seemed normal.
"I have no experience with the websites, so it was fine."
"There is some things that are normal to see on the website. The thing that is most different, in my opinion, is the schedule. When you click on the team it opens up a new page with the information on it."
"The design is fine, not cluttered at all."
Navigation is easy.
"It may be hard for someone who doesn't know cricket, but otherwise it's plain and simple."
The website is easy to understand.
kind of hard to understand with alot of writing
easy navigation
its about the two schools
seems pretty easy
The information on the site was clear and easy to read
I had no trouble navigating the website.
everything worked great for me
I felt it was an easy & straight-forward format
the websites looked clear and were easy for me to use. wasn't confusing or cluttered
I did not have any issues at all so i disagree. everything was where i had expected it to be.
i understood the main point as to what the website was trying to do.
"it looks like many websites i see today, maybe not with the same content, but it was very accessible."
"The website was not cluttered at all. The navigation links at the top were simple to follow, and the information displayed was tight, and legible. No clutter was found in my case."
"I feel that the website was very responsive to every single move that I made. Also, it was extremely simple to find the answers to the questions listed in the HIT. Everything was placed according to common sense."
"I thought the website provided it's job very well, and I knew exactly where to click right away. Every single link I visited provided the exact information that I wanted."
"The website was very similar to sites of the same genre. All of the information that I needed to access was in their respective places, and in plain view."
"No, it wasn't cluttered. It was very streamlined."
Your listed link is broken but I had no problems with the website itself once I got there.
"No, i had no issues whatsoever."
The website is different but if anything it made navigation easier as the links were readily available at the top of the screen.
I actually love how i looks with the pictures and the font.  It isn't cluttered.
There is some information I expected to find in certain sections that wasn't there.
I understood what it was doing.
It was a little difficult just because information wasn't where I expected it to be.
It was actually not cluttered at all
I had no problems
The links and everything worked fine
It looked a bit different but was easy to navigate
"Not only did I believe this webpage was not cluttered, I actually thought it was quite spacious."
The website was very easy to navigate and I never experienced any issues.
"It was never unclear what the purpose of this website was, or how to find information that I was seeking."
I have gathered information from a couple of these websites now and they have all been nearly identical. There is nothing confusing about it or hard about it at all in my opinion.
I thought it was neat and organized.
It was easy for me.
Website was clear to understand.
It seemed like other sites to me.
"I did not find the website design cluttered; however, some people may find the large background image of the cricket team to be a bit too much."
"I did not encounter any technical difficulties, but I did have to search for the information. For example, I had to click on ""TEAM"" to find out who the faculty adviser and alumni were."
"I did not have any trouble with what the website was doing. When I clicked on a link, it took me to that link quickly and without problem."
"I neither agree nor disagree with these comments, as I do not normally view cricket websites. However, it did not take me too long to find out the information."
Worked fine. No comments.
"Don't visit many similar websites, but again, was fine."
It does not look cluttered
I think the navigation worked well
I think the site is easy to understnad
The site is typical of other sites I have seen
