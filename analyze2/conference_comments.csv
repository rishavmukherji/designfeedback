Hire a better coder so it will look better.
I didn't find the website to be cluttered at all. I think it is a very good site visually.
I agree with this somewhat. The first thing I noticed about the website when I clicked on the home page was a lack of information. The home page should give a good description of what the initiative is all about and have a call to action. It should be more obvious where to go from there.
I agree with this. It took me a little while (or longer than it should have) to figure out the point of the site. This could be improved upon by having more information on the home page.
I'm not sure how different this site is to comparable sites but I do think it could be better organized to make actions a little more intuitive.
"The website was not cluttered to me at all. I felt that everything was spaced properly, and the text was very easy to read, as well as organized."
"The website was very easy to navigate, and I knew exactly where to go to find the information that I needed. Everything that I clicked was responsive, and in working order."
"I thought the website presented itself as easy to use, and I knew exactly what to do with the information once I reached the site."
"The website was very similar to websites that I have visited before. All of the information that I needed to access was in their respective places, and in plain view. There was nothing out of place that distracted me."
"Because page content on http://www.harvardusindiainitiative.com/ does not 'hide' behind the menu, when I scrolled down the page started to look cluttered because of the overlapping text and images."
Navigation seemed fine and I had no problems with the site or links causing behavior that I did not expect
"The underlined heading ""Register Here"" on http://www.harvardindiainitiative.com/#!registration/con8 may have confused some people as they might have thought it was a link"
"I was slightly confused about where to sign up for the conference, ""Apply Here"" was on the page and I was expecting to see something like ""Sign up"" or ""Register"""
There is far less clutter on this page than others. I found it realitvely easy to navigate and find information.
The only concern I have is that registering for the event is not clearly posted on the main page. You have to go to a seperate website in order to register. Everything else is how I expected it to be. The menu links lead to the pages that they should lead to.
There are descriptions on every page. There should be no confusion as to what it is supposed to be about.
Most websites have menus to navigate the site just like the one linked to above. I don't feel anything needs to be improved.
yea has alot of writing
seems simple to navigate through website
yes because they wrote alot
yeah seems aliitle hard and time consuming
Not cluttered at all.
"So far, I haven't had any troubles navigating the website."
Easy to understand.
It doesn't seem all that different.
I think the layout is fine and does not look cluttered
I thought the site was easy to navigate
I thought the website was easy to comprehend
They layout looks familar and similar to other sites I've seen
"I didn't think that the website looked too cluttered. I guess it's possible that they could've made things easier, but all in all, it's nothing that needs much time or attention focused on in my opinion."
I didn't have any problems navigating these webpages. I had no disruptions or anything that tried to make me perform a certain action before continuing. Very straight-forward.
It was very clear to me what the website was doing and what purpose the website served. Very easy to comprehend on my end.
"I can't imagine what issues anyone had with this website. It was very easy to navigate, self-explanatory and not difficult in the slightest."
The website was not cluttered.
Seemed straightforward.
The website did not behave abnormally.
The website seemed normal.
I actually thought it was pretty simple and clean.
I didn't have any issues navigating the website.
"I guess I don't know what you mean by ""doing"" What is it supposed to do?"
It seemed intuitive to me.
The floating menu at the top of the page blends in with background text.
This is one of the most fluidly designed websites I've seen in a while and I hardly agree with the above statements.
I had no problems navigating the webpage myself.
"Although registering took a bit of guesswork, it most certainly was not difficult at all for me to get around."
"If anything, I suggest making the labels have some sort of subheading. It seems somewhat simplistic and might be harder for the less computer literate to gain a strong understanding of the site."
"I disagree as long as you can read you'll know what to do,previous participants must of not paid attention"
i had no problems interacting with the webpage all was good
"Not true i find it easy to understand, no need for improvements"
"not sure, i think it looks great who ever created it did a good job on the design"
"It did not look cluttered, but some of the information was hidden in the other page and not placed on the main pages."
"It did not ask me to make changes, but I had to reload the registration page twice before it would let me view the page."
I understood what the website was doing.
"it wasn't hard or easy to navigat this page. Perhaps you could add a drop-down list to the main pages(Home, About, etc.) It was hard to find the ""registration"" page."
yup it was too much writing
yes it was
yea i wasnt sure what to do
yea not sure how to get info
the websites looked clear and were easy for me to use. wasn't confusing or cluttered
I did not have any issues at all so i disagree.
i understood the main point as to what the website was trying to do.
"it looks like many websites i see today, maybe not with the same content, but it was very accessible."
