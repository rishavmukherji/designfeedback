2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,I thought the website was well spaced.  The sidebar was very helpful
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,I had no problem navigating the website
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,I found the website very easy to understand
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,I found it very easy to understand
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,"It's not overly cluttered, but enough to think of why someone would make this."
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,This website is laid out poorly and ugly.
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,"I agree, it looks slapped together and ugly."
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,"The website doesn't tell me what it is, it immediately wants to sell me a book I have no knowledge about."
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,The site has a clean design and is not cluttered
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,I think the site is easy to navigate
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,The site is comparable to other sites
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,I was able to easily understand the site
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,Website is not cluttered.
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,Website seemed fine.
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,Website seems normal compared to other websites.
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,Website gives plenty of contact resources.
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,Everything is clearly labeled in the bar on the side and the site is the opposite of cluttered.
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,I was never asked to confirm a change before continuing.
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,I found it very easy to get the information I wanted from this site.  I can't imagine it to be easier anywhere else.
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,There is no elaboration for the new calculations but I'm assuming some of that would be in the book advertised.
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,I do agree it is a little cluttered. The layout of information could be put it in drop down tabs on the top of the website.
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,The website was self explanatory
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,The layout could be a little better and also things more organized. Finding a place where things should go compared to links just placed without any consideration the placement.
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,The documentation is understandable. The other people may not be familiar with the type of material that is on the website.
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,"The website was a little cluttered, or could've been set up a little more organized, but it was nothing that pushed me away from the site or gave me any negative feelings toward the site or the way it operated."
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,I didn't have any trouble navigating the site.
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,"This website was slightly different than some of the other information gathering websites that are comparable to this one, but nothing that was too out of the ordinary or hard to understand in any way."
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,The website had all of the helpful and necessary documentation that I needed. There was nothing about it that was confusing to me in any way.
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,"The website was less cluttered, more not finding the right thing right away. As in, it was difficult to find some things right away, or things were not in the places they usually would be with a website."
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,"I felt that the website was very responsive, and did exactly what I wanted it to. I had no issues finding a contact email or running the tennis simulation like described in the HIT."
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,"I feel that the overall layout of the website could be fixed. It seems really lackluster, and cheap. I feel that it needs some more content and professionalism, as well as more direction."
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,"I really didn't see any extra sections for help or guidance of the website, other than the contact page. Some more helpful navigation tools or frequently asked questions may help the situation."
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,It is not cluttered at all. It is very clean. Everything is neatly labeled.
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,I could not click on the website link from this survey. I had to copy and paste the website address from inside the parenthesis. The site was easy to navigate through.
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,I do not agree with this comment. I feel like this web design is basic and easy to navigate through. I feel like I've seen similar sites.
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,I'm not sure what the point of the tennis simulation part was for. I think the website is trying to convey a simple way to handle equations of business.
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,"I don't see how it would be hard to navigate, there are all the links on the top and left side..."
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,There should be a search bar at the top of the navigation!
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,"It's definitely not cluttered, if anything I'd like to see more content on there."
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,I found the website easy to navigate.
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,I've never really seen a website like this but I had no trouble with it.
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,"I didn't come across this problem, I understood everything."
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,It seems quite simple and quite navigable to me. I found myself flowing from page to page with relative ease.
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,The website was relatively easy to navigate and not difficult at all to use.
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,"No, this site is as simplistic as it gets. Only a fool couldn't navigate this site with ease."
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,"I didn't feel such documentation to be necessary at all. It was really a seamless process for me personally. If people would be more patient and take more time with these things, they would have less complaints."
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,it has alot of info
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,easy navigation
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,seems pretty easy to go to other links
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,some stuff seems kinda useles
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,The website was relatively minimalist and easy to understand.
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,I think the page is relatively straightforward and easy to navigate.
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,I have never used a website similar to this.  I think this website is easy to use and understand and has interesting tools.
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,The website did not explain how some of its probability tools and models work very well.
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,the website design looks good and there was no confusion in the website design.
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,the website works well and i find there is no problem.
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,no. the interface was very easy to work and understand.
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,"no, the website design looks so good and there was no confusion and the website provided everything good for easy understanding."
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,the websites looked clear and were easy for me to use. wasn't confusing or cluttered
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,I did not have any issues at all so i disagree. everything was where i had expected it to be.
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,"it looks like many websites i see today, maybe not with the same content, but it was very accessible."
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,"the website provided everything i was looking for, and in the first places i suspected them to be."
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,I thought the website looked nice and clean.
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,I thought the website was fairly easy to navigate and didn't do anything unexpected.
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,I thought the information was easy to understand and the website was designed well.
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,I didn't have this problem because I didn't have a problem understanding anything.
2andrew.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,it seems fine to me
2andrew.csv,error-prevention,yes seems to run fine
2andrew.csv,consistency-standards,it has alot of links
2andrew.csv,help-documentation,im not sure
2conference.csv,error-prevention,Hire a better coder so it will look better.
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,I didn't find the website to be cluttered at all. I think it is a very good site visually.
2conference.csv,error-prevention,I agree with this somewhat. The first thing I noticed about the website when I clicked on the home page was a lack of information. The home page should give a good description of what the initiative is all about and have a call to action. It should be more obvious where to go from there.
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,I agree with this. It took me a little while (or longer than it should have) to figure out the point of the site. This could be improved upon by having more information on the home page.
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,I'm not sure how different this site is to comparable sites but I do think it could be better organized to make actions a little more intuitive.
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,"The website was not cluttered to me at all. I felt that everything was spaced properly, and the text was very easy to read, as well as organized."
2conference.csv,error-prevention,"The website was very easy to navigate, and I knew exactly where to go to find the information that I needed. Everything that I clicked was responsive, and in working order."
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,"I thought the website presented itself as easy to use, and I knew exactly what to do with the information once I reached the site."
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,"The website was very similar to websites that I have visited before. All of the information that I needed to access was in their respective places, and in plain view. There was nothing out of place that distracted me."
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,"Because page content on http://www.harvardusindiainitiative.com/ does not 'hide' behind the menu, when I scrolled down the page started to look cluttered because of the overlapping text and images."
2conference.csv,error-prevention,Navigation seemed fine and I had no problems with the site or links causing behavior that I did not expect
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,"The underlined heading ""Register Here"" on http://www.harvardindiainitiative.com/#!registration/con8 may have confused some people as they might have thought it was a link"
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,"I was slightly confused about where to sign up for the conference, ""Apply Here"" was on the page and I was expecting to see something like ""Sign up"" or ""Register"""
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,There is far less clutter on this page than others. I found it realitvely easy to navigate and find information.
2conference.csv,error-prevention,The only concern I have is that registering for the event is not clearly posted on the main page. You have to go to a seperate website in order to register. Everything else is how I expected it to be. The menu links lead to the pages that they should lead to.
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,There are descriptions on every page. There should be no confusion as to what it is supposed to be about.
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,Most websites have menus to navigate the site just like the one linked to above. I don't feel anything needs to be improved.
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,yea has alot of writing
2conference.csv,error-prevention,seems simple to navigate through website
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,yes because they wrote alot
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,yeah seems aliitle hard and time consuming
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,Not cluttered at all.
2conference.csv,error-prevention,"So far, I haven't had any troubles navigating the website."
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,Easy to understand.
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,It doesn't seem all that different.
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,I think the layout is fine and does not look cluttered
2conference.csv,error-prevention,I thought the site was easy to navigate
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,I thought the website was easy to comprehend
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,They layout looks familar and similar to other sites I've seen
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,"I didn't think that the website looked too cluttered. I guess it's possible that they could've made things easier, but all in all, it's nothing that needs much time or attention focused on in my opinion."
2conference.csv,error-prevention,I didn't have any problems navigating these webpages. I had no disruptions or anything that tried to make me perform a certain action before continuing. Very straight-forward.
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,It was very clear to me what the website was doing and what purpose the website served. Very easy to comprehend on my end.
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,"I can't imagine what issues anyone had with this website. It was very easy to navigate, self-explanatory and not difficult in the slightest."

2conference.csv,error-prevention,I didn't have any issues navigating the website.
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,"I guess I don't know what you mean by ""doing"" What is it supposed to do?"
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,It seemed intuitive to me.
2conference.csv,error-prevention,The floating menu at the top of the page blends in with background text.
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,This is one of the most fluidly designed websites I've seen in a while and I hardly agree with the above statements.
2conference.csv,error-prevention,I had no problems navigating the webpage myself.
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,"Although registering took a bit of guesswork, it most certainly was not difficult at all for me to get around."
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,"If anything, I suggest making the labels have some sort of subheading. It seems somewhat simplistic and might be harder for the less computer literate to gain a strong understanding of the site."
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,"I disagree as long as you can read you'll know what to do,previous participants must of not paid attention"
2conference.csv,error-prevention,i had no problems interacting with the webpage all was good
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,"Not true i find it easy to understand, no need for improvements"
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,"not sure, i think it looks great who ever created it did a good job on the design"
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,"It did not look cluttered, but some of the information was hidden in the other page and not placed on the main pages."
2conference.csv,error-prevention,"It did not ask me to make changes, but I had to reload the registration page twice before it would let me view the page."
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,I understood what the website was doing.
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,"it wasn't hard or easy to navigat this page. Perhaps you could add a drop-down list to the main pages(Home, About, etc.) It was hard to find the ""registration"" page."
2conference.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,yup it was too much writing
2conference.csv,error-prevention,yes it was
2conference.csv,visibility-system-status,yea i wasnt sure what to do
2conference.csv,consistency-standards,yea not sure how to get info

2conference.csv,consistency-standards,"it looks like many websites i see today, maybe not with the same content, but it was very accessible."
2scratchpad.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,maybe alittle
2scratchpad.csv,error-prevention,easy to navigate
2scratchpad.csv,visibility-system-status,its about the two school
2scratchpad.csv,consistency-standards,no seems simple
2scratchpad.csv,aesthetic-minimalist,The website was fine.
2scratchpad.csv,error-prevention,Everything worked well.
2scratchpad.csv,visibility-system-status,The website seemed normal.
2scratchpad.csv,consistency-standards,"I have no experience with the websites, so it was fine."
2scratchpad.csv,consistency-standards,"There is some things that are normal to see on the website. The thing that is most different, in my opinion, is the schedule. When you click on the team it opens up a new page with the information on it."
